            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>
              My hobbies include playing chess, coding, playing guitar, and doing jiu-jitsu<br>
              I'm currently doing a few projects including frameworks like React, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and .NET<br><br>
              My favorite project is a flight simulator that will evetually use AI as an air traffic controller.<br>
              The AI will keep track of weather, traffic, and other factors to make sure the flights are safe and efficient.<br><br>
              I'm currently working for two companies, one is a software development company and the other is a game development company.<br>
              I need to work on front-end since it's clearly my weakest skill, but I'm working on it.<br>
